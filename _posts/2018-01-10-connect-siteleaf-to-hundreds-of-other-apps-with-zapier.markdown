Zapier connect's the apps you use every day to automate your work, so you can concentrate on the bigger creative tasks. Zapier makes it possible for your emails to trigger a new task in your time management tool, or your social media output to be saved in your cloud storage system. 

Before it was a struggle to get them all working in tandem. Now that [Zapier](https://zapier.com/zapbook/Siteleaf/) has 1,000 integrations, you can choose your favorite tools and easily integrate them with Siteleaf.




## How does Zapier work?
With Zapier you can set up your own codeless integrations called "Zaps". Zaps will automatically send information from one tool to another, so you'll spend less time manually transferring data between tools you use every day including Dropbox, Slack, Twitter, Typeform, Mailchimp, PayPal and 994(!) others.

Each Zap has one app as the **Trigger**, where your information comes from, which causes one or more **Actions** in other apps, where your data gets sent automatically. 

## How to connect Siteleaf to Zapier
Sign up for a free [Zapier](https://zapier.com/zapbook/Siteleaf) account, from there you can jump right in. Navigate to **Connected Accounts** from the top menu bar. Now click on **Connect new account** and search for **Siteleaf** Use your credentials to connect your Siteleaf account to Zapier.

Once that's done you can start creating an automation! Use a pre-made Zap or create your own with the Zap Editor. Creating a Zap requires no coding knowledge and you'll be walked step-by-step through the setup. 

## Go forth and automate
