Summer is the time for sun, sea, and Siteleaf. No, really. 

Lots of festivals use Siteleaf to manage their sites. Siteleaf makes it easy for content creators to update static sites while still optimizing for site speed. Here are a few of our favorites.

## Outside Lands

With sets from Janet Jackson, The Weekend, DJ Snake, Chvrches, Janelle Monáe, Carley Rae Jepson, and fifty more artists you can be sure that there’s something for you. 

[Outside Lands](https://www.sfoutsidelands.com/) is a festival that takes it’s food as seriously as it’s beats. Featuring goodies from the top talent in the Bay Area including truffled grilled cheeses, arepas, Taiwanese snow cones, and liquid chocolate bars. We’re not even sure what a liquid chocolate bar is, but you can bet we want to try one. 

They still have [tickets](https://www.sfoutsidelands.com/passes/) available for the weekend, including VIP passes if you’re feeling fancy.

## Grandoozy 

[Grandoozy](https://www.grandoozy.com/) has a sweet line up including Kendrick Lemar, Florence and the Machine, as well as the legendary Stevie Wonder. You can also break it down in the all-day dance area, which takes inspiration from Berlin’s infamous club scene. 

Showcasing Denver's craft brewery scene Grandoozy features 18 different breweries alongside Denver’s top distillers. Get involved and snap up [tickets](https://www.grandoozy.com/tickets/) for this September’s festival.

## Clusterfest

[Clusterfest](https://www.clusterfest.com/) is a comedy festival in San Fransisco, featuring comedians like Amy Schumer, Trevor Noah, and Tiffany Haddish alongside drag royalty Bianca Del Rio and Jinkx Monsoon.

You could also step into some of your favorite comedy shows with Clusterfest's unique experiences. Slip into Paddy’s Pub (from it’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia) for a pint, or munching down a Bluth’s Frozen Banana (from Arrested Development). Sadly Clusterfest is all out of bananas for 2018, but there’s always next June!

## Bristol Comedy Garden

Over the pond in England is a comedy festival that’s taking the South West by storm. [Bristol Comedy Garden](https://www.bristolcomedygarden.co.uk/) allows you to catch the best British comedians like Josh Widdicombe, Shappi Korsandi, and Alan Davis in a relaxed environment. 

Bristol Comedy Garden is a bargain, with tickets for each evening ranging from £20-£25. So it's no surprise that they sold out every show this year. Keep your eyes on their colorful [site](https://www.bristolcomedygarden.co.uk/) to see when next year’s line up gets announced.
