Jekyll 4.0 is out in the world, and brings upon many improvements over 3.x.

Notably, your site should build _much_ faster now thanks to super-powered caching and content transformations. You can see a [full list of changes here](https://jekyllrb.com/news/2019/08/20/jekyll-4-0-0-released/).

While GitHub Pages is still pinned to [Jekyll 3.8.x](https://pages.github.com/versions/), it‚Äôs possible to start using Jekyll 4 today with a little help from Siteleaf.

Check out our upgrade guide to get started:
