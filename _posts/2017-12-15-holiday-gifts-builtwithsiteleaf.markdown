At Siteleaf we are **really** behind on our Holiday shopping, so we turned to websites that use Siteleaf for some holiday inspiration and they delivered. 

Here are a few things that we would love to wake up and find under the tree:

![KEYCHAIN-022f3f.jpg](/uploads/KEYCHAIN-022f3f.jpg)

[**Girl‚Äôs Night In**](https://shop.girlsnightin.co) have a selection of goodies for any homebody on your list. We love their [going home after this keychain](https://shop.girlsnightin.co/collections/apparel/products/keychain), because it lets everyone know exactly where you would rather be for just $15. 




![CALENDAR-ef7772.jpg](/uploads/CALENDAR-ef7772.jpg)

This simple typographic [2018 Wall Calendar](https://rationale-design.com/shop/sans-wall-calendar/) created by [**Rationale Design**](https://rationale-design.com/) provides a beautiful and functional way to keep track of next year‚Äôs events for $25. It‚Äôs perfect for those who appreciate order and sleek design.

![AIDA-fdbc2d.jpg](/uploads/AIDA-fdbc2d.jpg)

Snack harder with [**Aida**](https://www.aidaeats.com). You can share these goodies at your holiday party or plough through them from your sofa whilst watching *It‚Äôs a Wonderful Life*. Either way we won‚Äôt judge. The [full Aida set](https://www.aidaeats.com/products/the-full-set) includes lemon candied pepitas, rye and sourdough crackers, currant turmeric crisps & szechuan candied pecans for $48. 

![STAR WARS BAG.jpg](/uploads/STAR%20WARS%20BAG.jpg)

The [Hattie Ewok Backpack](https://www.statebags.com/products/hattie-ewok) is inspired by the Forest Moon of Endor (that‚Äôs Star Wars talk for those of you who have been living light-years away). Also, the Rebel Alliance lining is üëå For $295 you‚Äôll get this great bag, and for every bag that [**State**](https://www.statebags.com) sells they hand-deliver a backpack packed with essential tools for success to an American child in need. Their website was designed by the great [Bondfire Inc](http://bondfireinc.com/work/state-bags-e-commerce-design-development/). 

![BE KIND.jpg](/uploads/BE%20KIND.jpg)

At the moment it can feel like the world is on fire. With this [Be Kind Banner](https://www.etsy.com/listing/540974808/be-kind-banner-wood-banner-wood-sign) $16.95 you can remind your family or colleagues to delight in kind gestures. Shop a whole selection of wood products made here in the USA at [**Woodshop**](http://www.woodshopusa.com). 

![KEEPCUP.jpg](/uploads/KEEPCUP.jpg)

[Shopping mates](https://shoppingmates.siroop.ch/blog/nachhaltige-weihnachtsgeschenke/) recommend these [**KeepCups**](http://us.keepcup.com/keepcup-series/tasting-notes-brew-cork-series/fika.html) which are $24. They‚Äôre made from fully tempered soda lime glass and the band is made with waste from wine cork manufacture. Great for the coffee lovers and the earth conscious alike. 

![TADA-124f16.jpg](/uploads/TADA-124f16.jpg)

Is there any home that couldn‚Äôt use a little more everyday celebration? We love this [Tada Emoji Embroidered Wall Hanging](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/200433048/embroidery-tada-emoji-embroidered-4-wall?ref=shop_home_active_14\) made by the brilliant [**Jessica Harllee**](http://jessicaharllee.com) for $70. We have one featuring the üëç emoji to spread the good vibes in the Siteleaf office. 

![NOURISH-38af27.jpg](/uploads/NOURISH-38af27.jpg)

These [**Nourish**](https://nourishsnacks.com) snacks are ideal stocking stuffers for the health nut in your life. The [Double Chocolate Granola Bites](https://nourishsnacks.com/snacks/double-chocolate/) are loaded with whole grain oats, chia, and chocolate for $16.60.
