Next week the Siteleaf team is heading west for the [GitHub Universe](https://githubuniverse.com) conference, October 11th and 12th in San Francisco.

If you are attending the conference or in the nearby area, [hit us up](https://twitter.com/siteleaf)! We'd love to meet up and chat with as many Siteleaf users as possible.

A few talks we're excited to see at GitHub Universe:
- Real-time collaborative editing: the science behind the magic
- Caring for your fellow developers
- Tools as a catalyst for culture change
- Accessibility: it's more than just screen readers
- Balancing identity & privacy: building tools to help users

As a proud sponsor of the conference, we're excited to offer [15% discount on tickets](https://githubuniverse.com/register/?promo=COMMUNITYU1715). Use the promo code `COMMUNITYU1715` and come hang with us!
